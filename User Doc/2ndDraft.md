# SurfsideSoftware's Calendar Widget User Doc

## Introduction: 

> Ryan is a computer science undergraduate student currently studying at UCSD; he is taking 4 classes, works part-time, and aims to consistently exercise, causing him to often have a lot on his mind. This causes Ryan to constantly stress about due dates and assignments creeping up on him, so he wants to be able to store all of his assignments and exam dates in an easily accessible calendar that can be interacted with to see his schedule for a certain day. Can anyone help him out?


Ryan and students with similar workloads can look no further, as ***SurfsideSoftware*** has developed a **Calendar Web App** that encompasses the current month and year, with an interface that can choose the current date and display the day's official holidays, an event list with corresponding times, and a daily quote to keep users inspired.

## Main Features: 

**Calendar**

The main calendar portion is on the left side, which displays the current month and year at the top left; below will be a grid of each day of the week along with their corresponding dates below. The current date will be highlighted by default, and the user can click on any given date to see the the entire agenda for the day on the right side of the screen. 

**Date Menu** 

Upon clicking a certain a certain date on the calendar, the right side of the screen will display the day of the weeek along with its date at the top. Any official holidays will follow right below, and a task/event list follows below that, which can be added to by the user upon clicking the "+" button to the right of the list.
