# Project Specs

## Calendar Widget Requirements
- Minimum Requirements -- First priority
  - Implemented using HTML/CSS/Javascript
  - Works for 3 main modern browsers on current version -- Chrome, Firefox, Safari
  - Main Calendar on left side of screen
    - Displays current month, with clickable days
    - The current month should be automatically displayed, with dates filled in correctly to baxes of the calendar
    - The calendar should signal/highlight what the current day is
    - Functionality on click can be easily built onto in the future, functionality itself might be implemented later (see below)
  - Daily status skeleton on right side of screen
    - Will not necessarily update alongside button clicks in minimum first completion -- functionality to be updated if time allows (see below)
    - Date + Day of week
    - Holidays
    - Daily Quote

- Additional Features -- Second priority
  - Reactive daily status - make displayed daily status non-static, and correspond correctly to selected day
  - Task list -- When clicked, associated task list for that day will be displayed on the right alongside existing day-to-day display
  - Adjustable scaleable size
  - Scrolling back and forth between past/future months
  - Light/Dark Mode
  - Reactive animations (i.e. clicking a date does something to show it was clicked)
  - Display additional information for dates, such as holidays
